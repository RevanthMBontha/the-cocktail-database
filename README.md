# the-cocktail-database

The Cocktail Database is a clear and concise guide on how to make your
own cocktails. All the cocktails present in the database are those
that have been recognized by The International Beverages Association
(IBA). So whenever you feel the itch to down a drink, try a new
cocktail from the list. Happy Drinking!

Each cocktail contains detailed information about the cocktail's name,
a reference image, it's ingredients, their measures, the drink's
preparation steps, the type of drinkware that is used for each drink,
and also contains some tips on making variations of the drink and how
they are served.
